# File Storage App

# Overview

I created this app to be able to have a place to store files on a website and be able to download them and other peoples who have an account as a sort of file sharing app. it makes it so you can only see others and add files once you have created an account. 

I wrote this to try and use Django with writing Python. I have written a few websites but none using Django and thought it would be fun to learn.

# Web Pages

I created 4 pages a home page which will show one of two things one where it welcomes you and asks if you want to register or login. where if you are already logged in it will ask if you want to logout or upload file and show you all the files that have been previously logged in. 

then I also created a login page where it has the user login. a register page for the user to register for an account. and an uploads page where the user can put the title and file they want to upload. 

# Development Environment

I used VS code as the editor and used Django as the framework with python being the language of choice.

# Future Work

* Making it where the user can put it public or on thier own personal account
* having it be a cleaner look and making the logout button in the nav versus on the page itself
* seperating the home page when the user is logged in versus a logged out or new user
